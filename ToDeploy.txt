Create a fresh deployment

Install Xammp(Dev), LAMP( production ) and Git-Bash
PHPStorm is recommended for developers, it has great git integration. Atom is a good free option though not as fully featured.

All CLI should be done with git-bash, not with windows command line, as I haven't tested it, and it's known to be wonky.

1. git clone https://github.com/holywar20/wh49v2
	Install composer at get `https://getcomposer.org/`
	`composer install --no-dev -optimize-autoloader`
	test 'php artisan' on CLI
2. Set up hosting path in xaamp
	--
	-- Create Database -

3. Set up .env file
	Copy .env.example
	name file '.env'
	Add all the config stuff you care about
	cli - php artisan:key generate
	Copy that value, and place it in the .env file under 'APP_KEY'

4. Goto path\app\providers\JWT.php and modify the key there for that deployment.
	I'm going to move this key to another place ( Maybe .env? ).
	For now simply never push JWT.php, that file shouldn't need to change. Otherwise your publishing your key to github!

5. Make a new user and test the App!


Communication flow
1. Vue Template
2. Vue Object
3. VmDataSend.dataCallName
4. Laravel Routes file ( routes/api )
5. Laravel Controller
6. VmDataSend gets promied data from web
7. Vue Object is notified
8. Something happens in Vue Object
